Self-Assessment
Completing the Computer Science program and building this ePortfolio has helped me define who I am as a developing software professional and how I want to contribute in the field. Across the program, I strengthened my ability to move from requirements to implementation, testing, and reflection, and the capstone process pushed me to present that work at a professional standard. The ePortfolio shows how I approach problems, how I improve earlier work, and how I apply software engineering, algorithms, databases, and security practices in a way that creates usable and maintainable solutions. Developing this portfolio also helped me clarify my professional values. I care about building systems that are reliable, understandable, and secure, and I want my work to be useful to both technical and nontechnical audiences.

My coursework gave me repeated opportunities to build these strengths in different contexts. In software design and engineering, I worked on projects that required planning, modular development, and iterative improvement. In databases, I learned how application behavior depends on the quality of data modeling, query design, and validation. In algorithm-focused work, I learned to evaluate how efficiently and clearly a solution solves the problem. In security-related work, I developed a stronger habit of looking for weaknesses early, including unsafe assumptions, poor validation, and design choices that could expose data or create instability. The capstone made these lessons more concrete because I had to revisit a prior project, evaluate it critically, and improve it in ways that demonstrate professional growth.

The program also helped me grow in areas that employers value during interviews and team-based work, especially communication and collaboration. Although my project was completed individually, I practiced skills that matter in team environments, including documenting design decisions, organizing code so others can maintain it, and writing explanations that connect technical choices to project goals. I also gained experience adapting communication for different audiences. In some assignments, the focus was on technical accuracy and implementation detail. In others, I had to explain business needs, constraints, and trade-offs in a way that supports decision making. This is important to me professionally because strong technical work has more impact when it can be clearly explained to instructors, teammates, managers, or clients. Outside the artifacts included in this ePortfolio, I also developed this skill through project discussions, milestone reflections, and revision cycles where I translated feedback into concrete improvements.

My experience in the program strengthened my understanding of data structures and algorithms as practical tools for decision making in software systems. I learned to think about how data is represented, how logic scales, and how design choices affect performance and maintainability. That mindset carried into my capstone enhancements, where I focused on making algorithmic work visible and explainable. I also improved my ability to evaluate trade-offs, such as when to do work in the application layer versus the database layer, and how to design logic that is testable and predictable.

Software engineering and database work are central strengths in this portfolio. Through coursework and capstone revision, I improved my ability to structure applications into clear components, separate concerns, and build code that is easier to maintain over time. I also gained stronger database skills by thinking beyond basic connectivity and retrieval and focusing on integrity, validation, aggregation, and performance. I learned that a well-designed application depends on a well-designed data layer, and that database decisions directly affect usability, reliability, and reporting quality. These experiences helped shape my professional goal of building complete solutions that balance functionality with maintainability and performance.

Security is another area that became more important to me as I progressed through the program. I developed a stronger security mindset by learning to identify vulnerabilities, validate inputs, limit assumptions, and design for predictable failure behavior. I view it as a design responsibility that should be considered from the start. This perspective improved the quality of my capstone work and has become part of how I evaluate software in general. It also supports my employability because organizations need developers who can build features while also protecting data, reducing risk, and recognizing how small design decisions can create larger security problems.

As a whole, the artifacts in this ePortfolio are connected by a common theme of growth through refinement. They represent different areas of computer science, but together they show how I approach software as an integrated discipline. The portfolio demonstrates my development in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases, while also highlighting communication, problem solving, and security awareness across those categories. Each artifact reflects a different part of my skill set, and the accompanying narratives explain how I evaluated the original work, planned improvements, and implemented enhancements that better align with professional expectations. Taken together, these artifacts show the progression from student assignments to stronger portfolio-ready examples that represent my capabilities and readiness to contribute in a computer science role.

This ePortfolio serves as both a record of what I built in the program and a professional introduction to how I think, communicate, and solve problems. It reflects the technical foundation I have developed, the standards I now apply to my work, and the directionI want to continue pursuing as I enter the field. My goal is to bring the same approach shown here to future opportunities: thoughtful design, clear communication, continuous improvement, and practical solutions that create value.
